# SpEcolCons2016
This repository contains the data and analyses used to put together my talk and a PDF copy fo the talk. I will at some point soon upload an RMD file of an isoslides RMD file.  

You can download the `SpEcolCons.R` script and run it in your preferred R environment. You will need an internet connection to load the data using the code on line 33.

Any questions please email me.
